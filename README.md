# 343-HW1

This is my submission for CIS 343 Homework 1. I frequently use git add, commit, push, and pull. Other git commands, such as branch creation, removal, and modification, I use a GUI for. I find removing and modifying branches in terminal to be both tedious and much easier to make a mistake with than using a GUI.
